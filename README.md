- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucaFriedrich
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, if you wanna know more about me reach out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, TypeScript, C#, Git, basically everything one needs to know.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really, need to get more experience before I collaborate.
- 📫 How to reach me stays a mystery, except you are one of the few selected individuals I actually enjoy conversing with.
